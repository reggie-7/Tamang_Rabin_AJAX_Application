# Earbuds Promotional Page 

This project is a continuation of the **Earbuds Promotional Page**. The goal is to integrate all concepts learned so far—**SASS**, **AJAX**, **the HTML element**, and the **Fetch API**—to create a fully dynamic and responsive Earbuds Model Page that displays and updates content based on user interaction.


## **Project Overview**

This web application loads earbuds information from a provided API endpoint and dynamically updates the view as the user interacts with various hotspots on the product image.

The page displays:

* Earbud model info
* Material descriptions
* Hotspot-based details
* Fully responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* Loading states during AJAX requests

The goal is to simulate a clean, interactive product page that showcases data-driven UI updates.
